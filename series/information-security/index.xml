Multiple Encryption and Triple DES Meet-in-the-Middle	Attack The	use	of	double	Data Encryption Standard (DES) results	in	a	mapping	that	is	not	equivalent	to	a	single	DES	encryption.
The	meet-in-the-middle	attack	algorithm	will	attack	this	scheme	and	does	not	depend	on	any	particular	property	of	DES	but	will	work	against	any block	encryption	cipher.
Triple	DES	with	Three	Keys Many	researchers	now	feel	that	three-key	3DES	is	the	preferred	alternative.</description>

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Background A clear replacement for DES was needed as DES have demonstrated exhaustive key search attacks. We can definitely use Triple-DES; however, it is slow with small blocks. In 1997, US NIST issued call for cipher in which 15 candidates accepted in June 1998 and 5 were shortlisted in August 1999. Rijndael was selected as the AES in October 2000 and issues as FIPS PUB 107 standard in November 2001.</description>

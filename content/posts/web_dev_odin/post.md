## HTML, CSS, & Flexbox
- To validate html code, use [validator](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html).

### HTML
- Bookmark [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) Read the “Welcome” message. Massive API documentation collection that even works offline. An essential collection of reference material for everything covered and more.
- [Don’t Fear the Internet’s video about HTML](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-elements-and-tags)
- [When to Use `<strong>`, `<b>`, `<em>`, and `<i>` Tags in Your Markup](https://medium.com/@zac_heisey/when-to-use-strong-b-em-and-i-tags-in-your-markup-fa4d0af8affb)

- [Chris Coyier’s When to use target=”_blank” on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/)

### CSS
- **Specificity** will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like a tie-breaker. An **ID** selector will always beat any number of **class** selectors, a **class** selector will always beat any number of **type** selectors, and a **type** selector will always beat any number of less specific selectors. When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.

- [Mozilla CSS values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units) can be used to learn the various types of values possible in absolute or relative terms.
- [An interactive Scrim](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co12d4cf99cf2776f19e84a9d) which covers much of the material in the lesson in an interactive form.
- [The CSS Cascade](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade) is a great, interactive read that goes a little more in detail about other factors that affect what CSS rules actually end up being applied.
- [Changing the Font Family](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css#finding-and-loading-a-font-file-from-a-hosted-service) describes a few different approaches to using custom fonts.
- [CSS Specificity Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0kfcP_nD9E) from Kevin Powell goes through various specificity examples and gives some advice on avoiding wrestling with specificity.
- [CSS Specificity Calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/) allows you to fill in your own selectors and have their specificity calculated and visualized.
- [Mozilla CSS Properties Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference) can be used to learn if a particular CSS property is inherited or not; simply look for the Inherited field inside the Formal Definition section. Here’s an example for the CSS color property.

### The Box Model
- The only real complication here is that there are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using padding, margin, and border. The assigned articles go into more depth on this concept, but to sum it up briefly:
  - `padding` increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
  - `margin` increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
  - `border` adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.

- [This CSS Tricks page](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/) has some further information about the margin property that you’ll find useful. Specifically, the sections about auto and margin collapsing contain things you’ll want to know.
- For a more interactive explanation and example, try this [Scrim on the box model](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cof3d488184abe24ec6258ab4).
- Watch [“this”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfXRw06FgK8) simple short video on What does the term “Normal Flow” Mean In CSS
- For a more interactive explanation and example, try this [Scrim on block and inline display](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co5024997a7e46c232d9abe55).

### Flexbox
- Flexbox gave us a ton of amazing new tools for laying out a web page. Compare these techniques to what we were able to do with floats, and it should be pretty clear that flexbox is a cleaner option for laying out modern websites:
  - Use `display: flex;` to create a flex container.
  - Use `justify-content` to define the horizontal alignment of items.
  - Use `align-items` to define the vertical alignment of items.
  - Use `flex-direction` if you need columns instead of rows.
  - Use the `row-reverse` or `column-reverse` values to flip item order.
  - Use `order` to customize the order of individual elements.
  - Use `align-self` to vertically align individual items.
  - Use `flex` to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.

- This beautiful [Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) covers everything you need to know. It will help reinforce concepts we’ve already touched on with some really fun and creative examples. Spend some time here, some of it should be review at this point, but the foundations here are important!
